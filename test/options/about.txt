<h1>Fargo Version [version] (Alpa)</h1><p>What does it do? It imports movies, TV shows and music information from XBMC and displays it on a web page.</p><p>Why is it called Fargo? It's called Fargo because I it's a movie, a place and I liked the name. Much better than the name of a depressed, annoying and nagging hobbit with diseased begging puppy eyes who cannot bear the burden of a small round lightweight piece of plastic with some ancient looking runes on it.</p>

<p>Why does it look like the XBMC's Confluence skin? Why not?!?</p><p>Has this something to do with the official XBMC team? No.</p>

<p>So can I get support from my beloved XBMC team? What part of the previous answer didn't you understand?</p>

<p>Where can I find the software? On the Internet with some help from Google. Just kidding. Go to <a href="https://github.com/Qzofp/Fargo">https://github.com/Qzofp/Fargo</a>.</p>

<p>Are there instructions how to install it. No, not yet. It's still under development or something.</p>

<p>Who created it? Fargo is created by Qzofp, who's too lazy to create an installation manual.</p><p>Do I know who you are? No... I hope not.</p>
