<div class="system_text"><i>"He who controls the Credits, controls the Internet! The credits must flow."</i><br/>
<p class="right">- Baron Harkonnen (Dune)</p>
<p>Every good book starts with a quote of a famous person. So I asked my good friend The Baron Harkkonen to deliver a nice one.</p>
<p>I want the thank my mother, father, my children, my wife, the neighbor's wife, her large breast and nice ass. My girlfriend who left me and my children who betrayed me. I want to thank God, in which I don’t believe, and all the other people who didn’t support or helped me one bit with the writing of Fargo.</p>
But really the credits goes to… 
<ul>
<li>Of course myself.</li>
<li>The excellent XBMC, formally known as the Xbox Media Player.</li>
<li>The tool guys (PHP, jQuery, JavaScript, JSON, HTML5, CSS3, NetBeans, Apache, MySQL, etc.).</li>
<li>The code guys from which I <del>stole</del> <del>borrowed</del> got inspiration from.</li>
<li>jQuery Plugin writers.</li>
<li>And many many others...</li>
</ul>
Thank you!<br/>
